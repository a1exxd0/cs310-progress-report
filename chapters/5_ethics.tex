\chapter{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues \& Considerations}
\label{ch:ethics}
As this project is largely theoretical in nature, involving literature review and computational simulation, it does not directly engage with sensitive personal data or human subjects. The primary professional considerations are therefore centred on academic integrity and responsible research conduct. This includes the rigorous and honest reporting of simulation results, transparently acknowledging the limitations of noise models used, and providing proper attribution to all sources and libraries used in accordance with their open-source licenses. The project will be conducted entirely within the ethical and professional guidelines set by the Department of Computer Science of the University of Warwick.

However, the research area of delegated quantum computing underpinning this project is deeply connected to significant legal, social, and ethical considerations. Whilst this work aims to make Quantum Machine Learning more practical, it touches upon the well-established ethical concerns of algorithmic bias and fairness. Whilst verifying computational correctness is distinct from verifying fairnes, it is a professional responsibility to acknowledge that any technology enabling powerful machine learning models must eventually be paired with governance to prevent inequitable outcomes.
